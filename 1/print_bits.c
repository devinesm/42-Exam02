Subject

Write a function that takes a byte, and prints it in binary WITHOUT A NEWLINE
AT THE END.

Your function must be declared as follows:
void print_bits(unsigned char octet);

Example, if you pass 2 to print_bits, it will print "00000010"

#include <unistd.h>

void print_bits(unsigned char octet)
{
	int i = 7;

	while (i >= 0)
	{
		char c = ((octet >> i) & 1) + '0';
		write(1, &c, 1);
		i--;
	}
}
